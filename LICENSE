Terms

1. License Grant (Non-Production).
   Subject to these terms, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
   non-transferable, non-sublicensable copyright license to use, copy, modify,
   create derivative works of, and distribute the Licensed Work for any purpose
   other than Production Use until the Change Date.

2. Production Use.
   “Production Use” means use of the Licensed Work, with or without
   modification, in or for the benefit of an application, product, or service
   provided to end users or other third parties, whether internal or external,
   other than for evaluation, development, or testing.

3. Additional Use Grant (Small-Org Production).
   Notwithstanding Section 2, Production Use is permitted before the Change Date
   if you meet the “Additional Use Grant” parameters set above. The Additional
   Use Grant does not permit you to offer the Licensed Work (or substantial
   portions of it) as a managed, hosted, or “as-a-service” offering to third
   parties. A commercial license from Licensor is required for that.

4. Change License.
   On the Change Date, the Change License specified above will apply to the
   Licensed Work. After the Change Date, you may, at your option, continue to
   use the Licensed Work under this license or under the Change License.

5. Distribution; Notice.
   If you distribute the Licensed Work or derivative works, you must
   (a) include a complete copy of this license,
   (b) retain all copyright, license, and attribution notices, and
   (c) clearly identify modifications you have made.

6. Termination.
   If you breach this license, your rights terminate automatically.
   If you cure the breach within 30 days of notice, your rights are reinstated
   unless and until you breach again.

7. Trademarks.
   This license does not grant rights to use Licensor’s trademarks, service
   marks, or trade names.

8. Disclaimer.
   THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
   KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES
   OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT.

9. Limitation of Liability.
   TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE
   FOR ANY DAMAGES, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE OR USE OF THE
   LICENSED WORK.
