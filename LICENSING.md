## Why BSL?
We want broad adoption and contributions **without** losing the economic path that funds the project. BSL lets small teams self-host, while nudging large enterprises and SaaS resellers to our **Cloud** or a **commercial license**.

## What you can do today
- Clone, build, and modify the code.
- Use it internally for development, testing, and evaluation.
- If you’re **<100 FTE** or **<$5M revenue**, you can run it in **production** for your own organization.

## What you can’t do without a commercial license
- Offer `/jargon` (or a substantial part of it) **as a managed/hosted service** to third parties.
- Use it in production if you’re **≥100 FTE** **and** **≥$5M revenue**.

## Examples
- **30-person startup** running internal copilots: ✅ Allowed.
- **Agency** deploying a **multi-tenant** hosted instance for clients: ❌ Not under BSL (commercial license required).
- **500-person enterprise** self-hosting for internal users: ❌ Not under BSL (commercial license or Jargon Cloud).
- **University lab** for research/teaching: ✅ Dev/test always; production depends on thresholds.

## Change Date
On **2028-09-10**, this code flips to **Apache-2.0**. From then on, you may use that version under Apache terms.

## Trademarks
This repo does **not** grant rights to use our names or logos in a way that implies endorsement. Ask us first.

## Commercial licensing & Cloud
- Need to host it for customers? Over the thresholds? Want indemnity and SLAs?
  → **Reach out at hello@jargon.ai**.
- Prefer not to self-host?
  → **Jargon Cloud** gives you the GUI, governance, versioning, integrations, and support.
